[VSLZR](https://vslzr.vercel.app/) is my blog where I post p5.js sketches.
The posts are mathematical or purely aesthetic in nature.
I try to provide some context or educational value to each post, however my main concern is making sketches.

My favorite favorite sketch is about [truchet tiles](https://vslzr.vercel.app/sketchbook/truchet-tiles). I recommend you check it out.
