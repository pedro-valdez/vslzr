# VSLZR 
A collection of p5.js sketches.

## What is VSLZR?
VSLZR is where I keep my p5.js sketches. The sketches exist to visualize
concepts, be aesthetically pleasing, or just for plain ol' fun; an accompanying
text is included, describing technical difficulties, curiosities, things I
learned, the concept at hand or whatever else might be of importance.

## Who created VSLZR?
I, Pedro Valdez, created this website. I am a web developer. However, once upon
a time lil' Pedro was not a web developer, but rather an aspiring programmer.
I found much to learn from YouTube channels such as [The Coding
Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) and
[thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/@thenewboston). I am forever grateful for
those who provide free and accessible content to satisfy the curiosity of a
young and curious mind. I am particularly grateful to The Coding Train for
providing an introduction to creative coding and encouraging people to let their
imagination run. Much love!
