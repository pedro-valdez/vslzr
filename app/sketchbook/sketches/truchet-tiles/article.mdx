I keep seeing tiles around me. First when I saw a hackernews post about the recent discovery of the first aperiodic monotile. Second when I saw a [YouTube video about tenPrint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyTZ5ZZxZs). And third when I somehow stumbled upon the [truchet tiles wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles). The p5.js muses must have been providentially guiding me to make a sketch.

To tesellate, or cover with tiles, the canvas pick randomly from a collection of tiles and then place it. Rinse and repeat until the canvas is covered. At least, that's the process for truchet tiles.

My favorite truchet tiling is with quarter circles. They are quite simple, but produce a very interesting tesellation.
