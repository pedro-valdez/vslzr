The <Link href="/sketchbook/monte-carlo-pi-approximation">Monte Carlo Pi Approximation</Link> sketch inspired this sketch.

The monte carlo pi approximation generates a random point from two uniformly distributed random variables, and then computes the distance from the origin. I wondered how the distribution of such method looked like, so I made this sketch.

[This stack exchange answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3311052/euclidean-distance-of-two-uniform-random-variables) provides a nice graph of the distribution.
